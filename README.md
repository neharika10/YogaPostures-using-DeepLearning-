# YogaPostures-using-DeepLearning-
This project is based on Deep Learning multi-class image classification.

 Let me get you through the procedure creating this project.
 
 DATASET: I made my own dataset from scratch by bulk downloading images of each category.
 
 
 CODE: With a lot of help from the internet I made the code (which I am really proud of) and successfully trained the data that predicted with about 95% accuracy. The one thing to 
 keep in mind while making your own code while taking a reference from another code is the changes you would need to make in order to get the desired output.
 For example: In my code I was not able to train my dataset for the life of it. And then after scanning and staring at the code for hours I found the problem.
 I needed to change the number of dense layers according to the number of categories I had.
